# particleman_gl
This is an assignment completed for an Intro to C college course I took. The requirement was to create any particle effect using a provided OpenGL boilerplate, in order to demonstrate understanding of memory management using a dynamically allocated linked list.
## Getting Started
Not much to it, clone the repo and run make.
### Prerequisites
OpenGL, freeglut, gcc, make.
If you're on Linux, you're likely good to go.
If you're on Windows, you'll have to install gcc, make, and download OpenGL + freeglut and change the Makefile to link against them.
If you're on OSX, you're on your own. I've never touched a Mac, sorry.
### Installing
Seriously, just run make and then run the compiled executable
